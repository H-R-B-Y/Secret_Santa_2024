# Secret Santa 2024

Every year I like to play secret santa with my friends, although my alterior motive is just an excuse to write some fun code.
Each year there is a twist, this year each player got to attach an image to the email that was sent to their santa, just for fun :)


## Usage
While I dont think you should use this code, the way I used it was to create a google forms form, then export this to CSV. 
I hard coded the column values in this code as that was quickest for me, with columns:

0 : Timestamp (default from forms).

1 : Email address of player.

2 : Players name.

3 : Players ideas for presents they might like.

4 : Image attachment. (manually downloaded from dropbox and updated the CSV path to the file)

Happy Holidays!
